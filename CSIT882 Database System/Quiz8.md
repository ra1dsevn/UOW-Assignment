Question 01
A relational table PROJECT(code, title, name) contains information about the projects. A row in a relational table PROJECT consists of a project code, project title and name of department working on a project. Assume, that at most one department works on a project and a department can work on many projects. A column code is a primary key and column title is a candidate key.

A relational table DEPARTMENT(name, chair) contains information about the departments. A row in a relational table DEPARTMENT consists of department name and chairperson name of a department. A column name in a relational table DEPARTMENT is a primary key. A column name in a relational table PROJECT is a foreign key referencing a column name in a relational table DEPARTMENT.

A correct implementation of a query “find the codes of projects implemented by the department chaired by Peter” is the following.

a.
SELECT code
FROM PROJECT
WHERE name EXISTS (SELECT name
                   FROM DEPARTMENT
                   WHERE chair = ’PETER’);

b.
SELECT code
FROM PROJECT
WHERE name IN (SELECT name
               FROM DEPARTMENT
               WHERE chair = 'Peter');

c.
SELECT code
FROM PROJECT
WHERE name NOT EXISTS (SELECT name
                       FROM DEPARTMENT
                       WHERE chair = ’PETER’);

d.
SELECT code
FROM PROJECT
WHERE name NOT IN (SELECT name
                   FROM DEPARTMENT
                   WHERE chair = ’PETER’);



* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The correct implementation of the query to find the codes of projects implemented by the department chaired by Peter is option b:

b.

```sql
SELECT code
FROM PROJECT
WHERE name IN (SELECT name
               FROM DEPARTMENT
               WHERE chair = 'Peter');
```

Explanation:

* This query first selects the department names where the chair is 'Peter' from the DEPARTMENT table.
* Then, it selects the project codes from the PROJECT table where the project's department name matches one of those selected from the DEPARTMENT table (those chaired by Peter).
* The `IN` clause is used here to specify that the `name` in the PROJECT table should match any of the department names returned by the subquery.
* The other options are incorrect because:
    * a. The EXISTS operator is used incorrectly. The correct syntax would involve a correlated subquery, which is not the case here.
    * c. `WHERE name NOT EXISTS` is also incorrect for the same reason as a, and it would not correctly identify departments chaired by Peter.
    * d. `WHERE name NOT IN` would exclude, rather than include, the projects implemented by departments chaired by Peter.

中文解释：

* 这个查询首先从 DEPARTMENT 表中选择主席是 'Peter' 的部门名称。
* 然后，它从 PROJECT 表中选择项目代码，其中项目的部门名称与 DEPARTMENT 表中选出的部门名称之一（由 Peter 主持的部门）相匹配。
* 这里使用 `IN` 子句来指定 PROJECT 表中的 `name` 应与子查询返回的任何部门名称匹配。
* 其他选项不正确，因为：
    * a. EXISTS 运算符使用不正确。正确的语法将涉及相关子查询，这里并非如此。
    * c. `WHERE name NOT EXISTS` 也不正确，原因与 a 相同，且无法正确识别 Peter 主持的部门。
    * d. `WHERE name NOT IN` 将排除而不是包括 Peter 主持的部门实施的项目。

Question 02
WITH clause of SELECT statement can be used to

a.
Process many SELECT statements simultaneously.

b.
Improve performance of processing of SELECT statement.

c.
Reduce the total number of line occupied by SELECT statement.

d.
Decompose a complex SELECT statement into a number of simpler SELECT statements.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The WITH clause of a SELECT statement can be used to:

d. Decompose a complex SELECT statement into a number of simpler SELECT statements.

Explanation:

* The WITH clause, also known as Common Table Expression (CTE), is used to simplify complex queries by breaking them down into simpler parts.
* It allows you to define one or more temporary sets that are valid only within the scope of a single query. These temporary sets can then be used in the main SELECT statement, making the overall query more readable and easier to maintain.
* While it does not inherently process many SELECT statements simultaneously (a), directly improve performance (b), or reduce the total number of lines (c), its primary benefit is in simplifying complex queries and improving readability.

中文解释：

* WITH 子句，也称为公用表表达式 (CTE)，用于通过将复杂查询分解为更简单的部分来简化复杂查询。
* 它允许您定义一个或多个仅在单个查询范围内有效的临时集。这些临时集然后可以在主 SELECT 语句中使用，使整个查询更易于阅读和维护。
* 虽然它本身并不直接同时处理多个 SELECT 语句（a）、直接提高性能（b）或减少总行数（c），但其主要优点在于简化复杂查询和提高可读性。

Question 02
WITH clause of SELECT statement can be used to

a.
Process many SELECT statements simultaneously.

b.
Improve performance of processing of SELECT statement.

c.
Reduce the total number of line occupied by SELECT statement.

d.
Decompose a complex SELECT statement into a number of simpler SELECT statements.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The WITH clause of a SELECT statement can be used to:

d. Decompose a complex SELECT statement into a number of simpler SELECT statements.

Explanation:

* The WITH clause, also known as Common Table Expression (CTE), is used to simplify complex SQL queries. It allows for the creation of temporary result sets that can be referenced within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.
* By breaking down a complex query into simpler parts with CTEs, it becomes easier to read and maintain. Each part of the query can be defined within the WITH clause and then used in the main query.
* While it does not inherently process many SELECT statements simultaneously (a), it can enhance readability and potentially improve performance by structuring the query more effectively. However, its primary purpose is not performance optimization (b).
* Reducing the total number of lines (c) is not the primary purpose of the WITH clause. It's more about clarity and maintainability of complex queries.

中文解释：

* WITH 子句，也称为公共表表达式 (CTE)，用于简化复杂的 SQL 查询。它允许创建临时结果集，这些结果集可以在 SELECT、INSERT、UPDATE 或 DELETE 语句中引用。
* 通过使用 CTE 将复杂查询分解为更简单的部分，查询变得更易于阅读和维护。查询的每个部分都可以在 WITH 子句中定义，然后在主查询中使用。
* 虽然它本身并不是同时处理许多 SELECT 语句 (a)，但它可以通过更有效地构建查询来增强可读性并潜在地提高性能。然而，它的主要目的并不是性能优化 (b)。
* 减少总行数 (c) 不是 WITH 子句的主要目的。它更多关于复杂查询的清晰度和可维护性。

Question 03
A relational view is


a.
A materialized result of processing of SELECT statement.

b.
A relational table that is a subset (a view) of another relational table.


c.
A virtual relational that occupies no persistent storage and it is computed from the very beginning each time it is used in SELECT statement.

d.
A relational table whose name starts from a a word VIEW.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

A relational view is:

c. A virtual relational table that occupies no persistent storage and it is computed from the very beginning each time it is used in a SELECT statement.

Explanation:

* A view in SQL is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. It contains rows and columns, just like a real table, but the data it contains is defined by a query.
* The key point about a view is that it does not store the data physically; rather, it's a set of queries applied to one or more tables. The data in a view is not stored separately and is generated dynamically when the view is accessed.
* A view is useful for hiding complexity, restricting access to certain data, or presenting a different representation of the data.
* The other options are incorrect because:
    * a. A materialized view stores the result of a SELECT statement, but this is not a characteristic of a standard view.
    * b. A view can be based on one or more tables, not necessarily a subset of a single table.
    * d. The name of a relational view does not need to start with the word VIEW.

中文解释：

* SQL 中的视图是基于 SQL 语句结果集的虚拟表。它包含行和列，就像一个真实的表一样，但它包含的数据由查询定义。
* 视图的关键点是它不物理存储数据；相反，它是应用于一个或多个表的一组查询。视图中的数据不单独存储，而是在访问视图时动态生成。
* 视图有助于隐藏复杂性、限制对某些数据的访问或呈现数据的不同表示。
* 其他选项不正确，因为：
    * a. 物化视图存储 SELECT 语句的结果，但这不是标准视图的特性。
    * b. 视图可以基于一个或多个表，不必是单个表的子集。
    * d. 关系视图的名称不需要以单词 VIEW 开头。

* * *

**You:**

Question 04
A relational view can be used to


a.
Decompose a complex SELECT statement into a number of simpler relational view definitions

b.
Improve performance of processing of SELECT statement.

c.
Reduce the total number of line occupied by SELECT statement.

d.
Process many SELECT statements simultaneously.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

A relational view can be used to:

a. Decompose a complex SELECT statement into a number of simpler relational view definitions.

Explanation:

* Views in SQL are often used to simplify complex queries. By encapsulating a complex SELECT statement into a view, you create a simpler interface for users or other parts of your application. This can make querying more straightforward and improve readability.
* Views can also abstract the underlying table structure, which is particularly useful in large databases where users may need to interact with a subset of the entire database without needing to understand the underlying complexity.
* While views can potentially improve the readability of queries (somewhat related to c), they do not inherently improve the performance of SELECT statements (b), reduce the number of lines in the original query (as they abstract complexity rather than reduce it), or process multiple SELECT statements simultaneously (d).

中文解释：

* 在 SQL 中，视图通常用于简化复杂的查询。通过将复杂的 SELECT 语句封装到一个视图中，您为用户或应用程序的其他部分创建了一个更简单的界面。这可以使查询更直接并提高可读性。
* 视图还可以抽象底层的表结构，这在大型数据库中特别有用，因为用户可能需要与整个数据库的一个子集进行交互，而不需要理解底层的复杂性。
* 虽然视图可能提高查询的可读性（与 c 有些相关），但它们本身并不提高 SELECT 语句的性能（b），不减少原始查询中的行数（因为它们抽象复杂性而不是减少它），也不同时处理多个 SELECT 语句（d）。

Question 05
The contents of a relational table can be permanently deleted with


a.
DELETE statement.

b.
DROP statement.

c.
PURGE statement.

d.
TRUNCATE TABLE statement.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The contents of a relational table can be permanently deleted with:

d. TRUNCATE TABLE statement.

Explanation:

* The TRUNCATE TABLE statement is used to delete all rows from a table, but it does not remove the table structure itself. It is a faster way to empty a table completely compared to the DELETE statement, especially for large tables, because it does not log individual row deletions.
* The other options have different effects:
    * a. The DELETE statement is used to delete rows from a table based on a condition. Without a condition, it deletes all rows, but this is slower and logs each deletion.
    * b. The DROP statement is used to delete the table itself, including its structure and contents.
    * c. PURGE statement is not a standard SQL command for deleting contents from a table. It's often used in the context of database administration to permanently remove objects from the database storage.

中文解释：

* TRUNCATE TABLE 语句用于从表中删除所有行，但不会删除表结构本身。与 DELETE 语句相比，它是一种更快的方式来完全清空表，特别是对于大表，因为它不记录每个行的删除。
* 其他选项有不同的效果：
    * a. DELETE 语句用于根据条件从表中删除行。没有条件时，它会删除所有行，但这更慢并记录每次删除。
    * b. DROP 语句用于删除表本身，包括其结构和内容。
    * c. PURGE 语句不是用于从表中删除内容的标准 SQL 命令。它通常用于数据库管理的上下文中，以永久性地从数据库存储中移除对象。

* * *

**You:**

Question 06
TRUNCATE TABLE statement belongs to

a.
Data Definition Language (DDL).


b.
Data Manipulation Language (DML).


c.
Data Administration Language (DAL).


d.
Data Access Control Language (DCL).

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The TRUNCATE TABLE statement belongs to:

a. Data Definition Language (DDL).

Explanation:

* The TRUNCATE TABLE statement is considered part of Data Definition Language (DDL) in SQL. DDL includes commands that deal with the structure of the database itself, such as creating, altering, and deleting tables.
* TRUNCATE TABLE is often grouped with DDL because it is a high-level operation that affects the entire table structure, removing all rows quickly without logging each row deletion. This is different from DELETE, which is a DML operation because it focuses on manipulating individual data rows and logs each deletion.
* The other categories do not align with the nature of TRUNCATE TABLE:
    * b. Data Manipulation Language (DML) includes commands like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, which deal with the manipulation of data within tables.
    * c. Data Administration Language (DAL) is not a standard classification in SQL.
    * d. Data Access Control Language (DCL) includes commands related to permissions and access control, such as GRANT and REVOKE.

中文解释：

* TRUNCATE TABLE 语句被认为是 SQL 中数据定义语言（DDL）的一部分。DDL 包括处理数据库结构本身的命令，如创建、修改和删除表。
* TRUNCATE TABLE 通常被归类为 DDL，因为它是一种高级操作，影响整个表结构，快速移除所有行而不记录每行删除。这与 DELETE 不同，DELETE 是 DML 操作，因为它专注于操作单个数据行并记录每次删除。
* 其他类别不符合 TRUNCATE TABLE 的性质：
    * b. 数据操作语言（DML）包括 INSERT、UPDATE、DELETE 等命令，这些命令涉及对表内数据的操作。
    * c. 数据管理语言（DAL）不是 SQL 中的标准分类。
    * d. 数据访问控制语言（DCL）包括与权限和访问控制相关的命令，如 GRANT 和 REVOKE。

Question 07
A relational table can be copied to another relational table with the following SQL statement.


a.
UPDATE with a subquery.

b.
CREATE TABLE with a subquery.

c.
INSERT with a subquery.

d.
COPY with a subquery.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

A relational table can be copied to another relational table with the following SQL statement:

b. CREATE TABLE with a subquery.

Explanation:

* The `CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT` statement (CREATE TABLE with a subquery) is used to create a new table in the database by copying the existing table's columns. This statement creates a new table and populates it with the data returned by the subquery.
* Here's an example of how it's used:
  
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE new_table AS SELECT * FROM existing_table;
    ```
    
    This statement creates a new table named `new_table` with the same structure as `existing_table` and copies all rows from `existing_table` into `new_table`.
* The other options are not typically used for copying an entire table:
    * a. UPDATE with a subquery is used for updating existing rows in a table.
    * c. INSERT with a subquery is used to insert data into an existing table, not to create a new table.
    * d. COPY with a subquery is not a standard SQL command for copying tables.

中文解释：

* `CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT` 语句（使用子查询的 CREATE TABLE）用于通过复制现有表的列来创建数据库中的新表。此语句创建一个新表，并用子查询返回的数据填充它。
* 例如，它的使用方法如下：
  
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE new_table AS SELECT * FROM existing_table;
    ```
    
    这个语句创建了一个名为 `new_table` 的新表，其结构与 `existing_table` 相同，并将 `existing_table` 中的所有行复制到 `new_table` 中。
* 其他选项通常不用于复制整个表：
    * a. 带子查询的 UPDATE 用于更新表中的现有行。
    * c. 带子查询的 INSERT 用于向现有表中插入数据，而不是创建新表。
    * d. 带子查询的 COPY 不是复制表的标准 SQL 命令。

* * *

Question 08
When creating a relational table with CREATE TABLE statement with a subquery, the only consistency constraint,that is automatically created is

a.
Primary key constraint.


b.
NULL/NOT NULL constraint.

c.
Domain constraint.


d.
CHECK constraint.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

When creating a relational table with the CREATE TABLE statement with a subquery, the only consistency constraint that is automatically created is:

b. NULL/NOT NULL constraint.

Explanation:

* When a new table is created using the `CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT` statement, the only constraints that are automatically carried over from the original table are the NULL/NOT NULL constraints on the columns.
* This means that if a column in the original table was defined to not allow NULL values (NOT NULL), this constraint will apply to the same column in the new table.
* Other constraints, such as primary keys, domain constraints, or check constraints, are not automatically transferred to the new table. These would need to be defined explicitly if required.
* Therefore, options a, c, and d are not correct in this context, as primary key, domain, and CHECK constraints are not automatically created with this method of table creation.

中文解释：

* 使用 `CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT` 语句创建新表时，唯一自动从原始表传递过来的约束是列的 NULL/NOT NULL 约束。
* 这意味着，如果原始表中的某个列被定义为不允许 NULL 值（NOT NULL），这个约束将适用于新表中的同一个列。
* 其他约束，如主键、域约束或检查约束，并不会自动转移到新表。如果需要，这些需要明确定义。
* 因此，在这种情况下，选项 a、c 和 d 不正确，因为主键、域和 CHECK 约束并不会在此表创建方法中自动创建。

* * *

**You:**

Question 09
INSERT statement with a subquery

a.
Appends the results of subquery to an already existing relational table.

b.
Creates a new relational table and inserts the results of subquery.

c.
Overrides the contents of an already existing relational table.

d.
Generates INSERT statement with values that can be later on used to insert data.



* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The INSERT statement with a subquery:

a. Appends the results of the subquery to an already existing relational table.

Explanation:

* The INSERT statement with a subquery is used to insert rows into an existing table. The rows that are inserted are the result of the subquery.
* This allows for dynamic insertion of data based on the results of another SELECT statement. For example:
  
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO table1 (column1, column2)
    SELECT columnA, columnB FROM table2;
    ```
    
    This would insert into `table1` the results of the SELECT statement from `table2`.
* The other options do not correctly describe the INSERT statement with a subquery:
    * b. It does not create a new table; it adds to an existing table.
    * c. It does not override the existing contents of the table but adds new rows.
    * d. It does not generate an INSERT statement for later use; it performs the insertion immediately.

中文解释：

* 带子查询的 INSERT 语句用于向已存在的表中插入行。被插入的行是子查询的结果。
* 这允许基于另一个 SELECT 语句的结果动态地插入数据。例如：
  
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO table1 (column1, column2)
    SELECT columnA, columnB FROM table2;
    ```
    
    这会将从 `table2` 的 SELECT 语句的结果插入到 `table1` 中。
* 其他选项没有正确描述带子查询的 INSERT 语句：
    * b. 它不创建新表；它向现有表中添加数据。
    * c. 它不会覆盖表中现有的内容，而是添加新行。
    * d. 它不生成供以后使用的 INSERT 语句；它立即执行插入操作。

Question 10
DELETE statement with a subquery

a.
Deletes all rows that satisfy WHERE condition.

b.
Deletes all rows that do not satisfy WHERE condition.

c.
Deletes all rows except the rows retrieved by a subquery.

d.
Deletes all rows retrieved by a subquery.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The DELETE statement with a subquery:

d. Deletes all rows retrieved by a subquery.

Explanation:

* The DELETE statement with a subquery is used to remove rows from a table based on a condition specified in the subquery. The subquery identifies the rows to be deleted.
* Essentially, this statement deletes rows from a table where the specified condition (usually in the WHERE clause) matches the results obtained from the subquery.
* For example:
  
    ```sql
    DELETE FROM table1
    WHERE column1 IN (SELECT columnA FROM table2);
    ```
    
    This statement will delete from `table1` all rows where the value of `column1` matches any value in `columnA` from `table2`.
* The other options are not correct interpretations of the DELETE statement with a subquery:
    * a. Deletes all rows that satisfy WHERE condition, but not specifically mentioning the role of subquery.
    * b. This is not typically how a DELETE statement with a subquery is structured.
    * c. This implies exclusion of the rows returned by the subquery, which is not the usual case.

中文解释：

* 带子查询的 DELETE 语句用于根据子查询中指定的条件从表中删除行。子查询识别要删除的行。
* 本质上，此语句删除表中满足特定条件（通常在 WHERE 子句中）与子查询结果相匹配的行。
* 例如：
  
    ```sql
    DELETE FROM table1
    WHERE column1 IN (SELECT columnA FROM table2);
    ```
    
    这个语句将从 `table1` 中删除所有 `column1` 的值与 `table2` 中的 `columnA` 任一值匹配的行。
* 其他选项不是对带子查询的 DELETE 语句的正确解释：
    * a. 删除所有满足 WHERE 条件的行，但没有具体提到子查询的作用。
    * b. 这通常不是带子查询的 DELETE 语句的结构。
    * c. 这意味着排除子查询返回的行，这通常不是情况。

Question 11
UPDATE statement with a subquery can have only

a.
At most one subquery in WHERE clause.

b.
At most three subqueries, one in SET clause, one in WHERE clause and one in UPDATE clause.

c.
At most two subqueries, one in SET clause and one in WHERE clause.

d.
At most four subqueries, one in SET clause, one in WHERE clause, one in UPDATE clause, and one in MERGE clause.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The UPDATE statement with a subquery can have only:

c. At most two subqueries, one in SET clause and one in WHERE clause.

Explanation:

* In an UPDATE statement with subqueries, you can use subqueries in both the SET and WHERE clauses.
* The SET clause subquery is used to determine the new value to set for a column, and the WHERE clause subquery is used to identify the rows that should be updated.
* For example:
  
    ```sql
    UPDATE table1
    SET column1 = (SELECT value FROM table2 WHERE condition)
    WHERE column2 IN (SELECT value FROM table3 WHERE condition);
    ```
    
    Here, the subquery in the SET clause determines the new value for `column1`, and the subquery in the WHERE clause identifies which rows in `table1` should be updated.
* The other options are not standard practices in SQL:
    * a. More than one subquery can be used in an UPDATE statement.
    * b. While it's possible to have a subquery in the SET and WHERE clauses, there is typically no subquery in the UPDATE clause itself.
    * d. The UPDATE clause and MERGE clause do not typically contain subqueries within them in standard SQL usage.

中文解释：

* 在带子查询的 UPDATE 语句中，您可以在 SET 子句和 WHERE 子句中使用子查询。
* SET 子句中的子查询用于确定要为列设置的新值，而 WHERE 子句中的子查询用于识别应该更新的行。
* 例如：
  
    ```sql
    UPDATE table1
    SET column1 = (SELECT value FROM table2 WHERE condition)
    WHERE column2 IN (SELECT value FROM table3 WHERE condition);
    ```
    
    这里，SET 子句中的子查询确定 `column1` 的新值，而 WHERE 子句中的子查询识别应该更新 `table1` 中哪些行。
* 其他选项不是 SQL 中的标准做法：
    * a. 在 UPDATE 语句中可以使用多个子查询。
    * b. 尽管可以在 SET 和 WHERE 子句中有子查询，但 UPDATE 子句本身通常不包含子查询。
    * d. 在标准的 SQL 使用中，UPDATE 子句和 MERGE 子句通常不包含它们内部的子查询。

解释：

* 在带子查询的 UPDATE 语句中，你可以在 SET 子句和 WHERE 子句中使用子查询。
* SET 子句中的子查询用来确定列的新值，而 WHERE 子句中的子查询用来识别应该更新的行。
* 例如：

    UPDATE table1
    SET column1 = (SELECT value FROM table2 WHERE condition)

Question 12
A relational table PROJECT(code, title, name) contains information about the projects. A row in a relational table PROJECT consists of a project code, project title and name of department working on a project. Assume, that at most one department works on a project and a department can work on many projects. A column code is a primary key and column title is a candidate key.

A relational table DEPARTMENT(name, chair) contains information about the departments. A row in a relational table DEPARTMENTconsists of department name and chairperson name of a department. A column name in a relational table DEPARTMENT is a primary key. A column name in a relational table PROJECT is a foreign key referencing a column name in a relational table DEPARTMENT.

A correct implementation of a query “find the chairs of departments that implement a project with a code ’P123’ “ is the following.

a.
SELECT chair
FROM DEPARTMENT
WHERE name = (SELECT name
              FROM PROJECT
              WHERE code = ’P123’);

b.
SELECT chair
FROM DEPARTMENT
WHERE name IN (SELECT name                 FROM PROJECT
                WHERE code = ’P123’);

c.
SELECT chair
FROM PROJECT
WHERE code = ’P123’ AND
              name NOT IN (SELECT name
                           FROM DEPARTMENT);

d.
SELECT chair
FROM PROJECT
WHERE code = ’P123’ AND
              name IN (SELECT name
                       FROM DEPARTMENT);

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The correct implementation of the query to “find the chairs of departments that implement a project with a code ’P123’” is option a:

a.

```sql
SELECT chair
FROM DEPARTMENT
WHERE name = (SELECT name
              FROM PROJECT
              WHERE code = 'P123');
```

Explanation:

* This query first selects the department name from the PROJECT table where the project code is 'P123'.
* Then, it retrieves the chair of the department from the DEPARTMENT table that matches this department name.
* It assumes a relational model where each project in the PROJECT table references a department in the DEPARTMENT table, and we are interested in the chairperson of the department that is working on the project with code 'P123'.

The other options are incorrect because:

* b. While it might seem similar to option a, `WHERE name IN` is not necessary here as the subquery will return only one name.
* c. This query incorrectly tries to select chairs from the PROJECT table and uses a condition that excludes names present in the DEPARTMENT table.
* d. This query, like option c, incorrectly attempts to select chairs from the PROJECT table.

中文解释：

正确实现“查找实施项目代码为 'P123' 的部门主席”的查询是选项 a：

a.

```sql
SELECT chair
FROM DEPARTMENT
WHERE name = (SELECT name
              FROM PROJECT
              WHERE code = 'P123');
```

解释：

* 这个查询首先从 PROJECT 表中选择项目代码为 'P123' 的部门名称。
* 然后，它从 DEPARTMENT 表中检索与此部门名称匹配的部门主席。
* 它假设一个关系模型，其中 PROJECT 表中的每个项目引用 DEPARTMENT 表中的一个部门，我们感兴趣的是负责代码为 'P123' 项目的部门的主席。

其他选项不正确，因为：

* b. 虽然看起来与选项 a 类似，但这里不需要 `WHERE name IN`，因为子查询只会返回一个名称。
* c. 这个查询错误地尝试从 PROJECT 表中选择主席，并使用排除 DEPARTMENT 表中存在的名称的条件。
* d. 这个查询像选项 c 一样，错误地尝试从 PROJECT 表中选择主席。

Question 13
Each time a name of a relational view is used in SELECT statement

a.
a syntax error is returned because a name of relational view a cannot be used in SELECT statement.

b.
the rows are copied into SELECT statement before processing.

c.
the view recomputed from very beginning.

d.
a database system searches for a definition of the view in WITH clause.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The correct answer to the question "Each time a name of a relational view is used in SELECT statement" is:

c. the view is recomputed from the very beginning.

Explanation:

* When a relational view's name is used in a SELECT statement, the database system treats it as a virtual table. Each time the view is accessed, the underlying SQL query that defines the view is executed. This means the view is recomputed from scratch based on its defining SELECT statement.
* Views do not store data themselves; they dynamically generate data when called. This recomputation ensures that the view's data is always up-to-date with respect to the base tables it references.

The other options are incorrect because:

* a. A relational view's name can indeed be used in a SELECT statement; it does not result in a syntax error.
* b. Rows are not copied into the SELECT statement before processing. Views are virtual tables and do not hold data themselves.
* d. The database system does not search for a definition of the view in a WITH clause. The view's definition is stored in the database system, and it is accessed whenever the view is queried.

中文解释：

当关系视图的名称在 SELECT 语句中使用时：

c. 视图会从一开始就重新计算。

解释：

* 当在 SELECT 语句中使用关系视图的名称时，数据库系统将其视为虚拟表。每次访问视图时，定义视图的底层 SQL 查询都会被执行。这意味着视图是根据其定义的 SELECT 语句从头开始重新计算的。
* 视图本身不存储数据；它们在被调用时动态生成数据。这种重新计算确保视图数据始终与其引用的基表数据保持最新。

其他选项不正确，因为：

* a. 关系视图的名称确实可以在 SELECT 语句中使用；它不会导致语法错误。
* b. 行在处理之前不会被复制到 SELECT 语句中。视图是虚拟表，不自己持有数据。
* d. 数据库系统不会在 WITH 子句中查找视图的定义。视图的定义存储在数据库系统中，每当查询视图时都会访问它。

Question 14
A relational table PROJECT(code, title, name) contains information about the projects. A row in a relational table PROJECT consists of a project code, project title and name of department working on a project. Assume, that at most one department works on a project and a department can work on many projects. A column code is a primary key and column title is a candidate key.

A relational table DEPARTMENT(name, chair) contains information about the departments. A row in a relational table DEPARTMENT consists of department name and chairperson name of a department. A column name in a relational table DEPARTMENT is a primary key. A column name in a relational table PROJECTis a foreign key referencing a column name in a relational table DEPARTMENT.

A correct implementation of a query “find the chairs of departments that implement a project with a code ’P123’ “ is the following.

a.
SELECT chair
FROM DEPARTMENT
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT ‘whatever’
                  FROM PROJECT
                  WHERE code &lt;&gt; ’P123’ AND
                        PROJECT.name = DEPARTMENT.name);

b.
SELECT chair
FROM DEPARTMENT
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ‘whatever’
              FROM PROJECT
              WHERE code = ’P123’ AND
                    name = dname);


c.
SELECT chair
FROM DEPARTMENT
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ‘whatever’
              FROM PROJECT
              WHERE code = ’P123’ AND
                    PROJECT.name = DEPARTMENT.name);


d.
SELECT chair
FROM DEPARTMENT
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ‘whatever’
              FROM PROJECT
              WHERE code = ’P123’);



* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The correct implementation of the query to “find the chairs of departments that implement a project with a code ’P123’” is option c:

c.

```sql
SELECT chair
FROM DEPARTMENT
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ‘whatever’
              FROM PROJECT
              WHERE code = ’P123’ AND
                    PROJECT.name = DEPARTMENT.name);
```

Explanation:

* This query checks for the existence of a project with code 'P123' in the PROJECT table that is associated with a department in the DEPARTMENT table.
* The `EXISTS` clause is used here to determine if there is at least one row in the PROJECT table that meets the condition `code = 'P123' AND PROJECT.name = DEPARTMENT.name`. If such a row exists, it implies that the department in question is working on a project with code 'P123'.
* The `SELECT ‘whatever’` part of the subquery is a placeholder and is not relevant to the logic of the EXISTS clause; the presence of any row meeting the criteria is sufficient.

The other options are incorrect because:

* a. The condition `WHERE NOT EXISTS` and `code <> 'P123'` would incorrectly exclude the desired departments.
* b. The reference to `name = dname` is incorrect as `dname` is not defined in the given schema.
* d. This condition does not link the PROJECT and DEPARTMENT tables to ensure the project is associated with the department.

中文解释：

正确实现“查找实施项目代码为 'P123' 的部门主席”的查询是选项 c：

c.

```sql
SELECT chair
FROM DEPARTMENT
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ‘whatever’
              FROM PROJECT
              WHERE code = ’P123’ AND
                    PROJECT.name = DEPARTMENT.name);
```

解释：

* 这个查询检查 PROJECT 表中是否存在与 DEPARTMENT 表中的部门关联的项目代码为 'P123' 的项目。
* 这里使用 `EXISTS` 子句来确定 PROJECT 表中是否至少有一行满足条件 `code = 'P123' AND PROJECT.name = DEPARTMENT.name`。如果存在这样的行，这意味着该部门正在进行代码为 'P123' 的项目。
* 子查询中的 `SELECT ‘whatever’` 部分是一个占位符，与 EXISTS 子句的逻辑无关；满足条件的任何行都足够。

其他选项不正确，因为：

* a. `WHERE NOT EXISTS` 和 `code <> 'P123'` 的条件会错误地排除所需的部门。
* b. 对 `name = dname` 的引用不正确，因为给定的架构中没有定义 `dname`。
* d. 这个条件没有将 PROJECT 和 DEPARTMENT 表链接起来，以确保项目与部门关联。

Question 15
A relational table PROJECT(code, title, name) contains information about the projects. A row in a relational table PROJECT consists of a project code, project title and name of department working on a project. Assume, that at most one department works on a project and a department can work on many projects. A column code is a primary key and column title is a candidate key.

A relational table DEPARTMENT(name, chair) contains information about the departments. A row in a relational table DEPARTMENT consists of department name and chairperson name of a department. A column name in a relational table DEPARTMENT is a primary key. A column name in a relational table PROJECT is a foreign key referencing a column name in a relational table DEPARTMENT.

A correct implementation of a query “find the codes of projects implemented by the department chaired by Peter” is the following.

a.
SELECT code
FROM PROJECT
WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT *
               FROM DEPARTMENT

在解答的最后，解释 PROJECT.name = DEPARTMENT.name)是什么意思

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The correct implementation of the query to “find the codes of projects implemented by the department chaired by Peter” is option b:

b.

```sql
SELECT code
FROM PROJECT
WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT *
               FROM DEPARTMENT
               WHERE chair = 'Peter' AND
                     PROJECT.name = DEPARTMENT.name );
```

Explanation:

* This query checks if there exists a department in the DEPARTMENT table chaired by Peter that is associated with a project in the PROJECT table.
* The `EXISTS` clause is used to determine if there is at least one row in the DEPARTMENT table that meets the condition `chair = 'Peter' AND PROJECT.name = DEPARTMENT.name`. If such a row exists, it means that the department chaired by Peter is working on the project.
* The `PROJECT.name = DEPARTMENT.name` part of the WHERE clause is crucial. It ensures that the project in the PROJECT table is associated with the department in the DEPARTMENT table. Since `name` in PROJECT is a foreign key referencing `name` in DEPARTMENT, this condition links a project to its corresponding department.

The other options are incorrect because:

* a. It does not correctly link the PROJECT and DEPARTMENT tables to ensure the project is associated with Peter's department.
* c. This query is incorrectly attempting to select project codes from the DEPARTMENT table.
* d. While it attempts to link PROJECT and DEPARTMENT, the use of 'Peter' as the `name` in the WHERE clause is incorrect, as 'Peter' should be the value of the `chair` column.

中文解释：

正确实现“查找由彼得主持的部门实施的项目代码”的查询是选项 b：

b.

```sql
SELECT code
FROM PROJECT
WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT *
               FROM DEPARTMENT
               WHERE chair = 'Peter' AND
                     PROJECT.name = DEPARTMENT.name );
```

解释：

* 这个查询检查 DEPARTMENT 表中是否存在由彼得主持且与 PROJECT 表中项目相关联的部门。
* `EXISTS` 子句用于确定 DEPARTMENT 表中是否至少有一行满足条件 `chair = 'Peter' AND PROJECT.name = DEPARTMENT.name`。如果存在这样的行，这意味着彼得主持的部门正在进行该项目。
* WHERE 子句中的 `PROJECT.name = DEPARTMENT.name` 部分至关重要。它确保了 PROJECT 表中的项目与 DEPARTMENT 表中的部门相关联。由于 PROJECT 中的 `name` 是引用 DEPARTMENT 中的 `name` 的外键，这个条件将项目与其对应的部门链接起来。

其他选项不正确，因为：

* a. 它没有正确地链接 PROJECT 和 DEPARTMENT 表以确保项目与彼得的部门相关联。
* c. 这个查询错误地尝试从 DEPARTMENT 表中选择项目代码。
* d. 尽管它试图链接 PROJECT 和 DEPARTMENT，但 WHERE 子句中使用 'Peter' 作为 `name` 是不正确的，因为 'Peter' 应该是 `chair` 列的值。

PROJECT.name = DEPARTMENT.name是什么意思？项目名和部门名要一致吗？解答完这个以后开始Question 16
A relational table PROJECT(code, title, name) contains information about the projects. A row in a relational table PROJECT consists of a project code, project title and name of department working on a project. Assume, that at most one department works on a project and a department can work on many projects. A column code is a primary key and column title is a candidate key.

A relational table DEPARTMENT(name, chair) contains information about the departments. A row in a relational table DEPARTMENT consists of department name and chairperson name of a department. A column name in a relational table DEPARTMENT is a primary key. A column name in a relational table PROJECT is a foreign key referencing a column name in a relational table DEPARTMENT.

A correct implementation of a query “find the names of departments that do not work on any projects now” is the following.

a.
SELECT name
FROM PROJECT
WHERE name NOT IN (SELECT name
                   FROM DEPARTMENT);

b.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

首先，我来解释 "PROJECT.name = DEPARTMENT.name" 的含义。在这个上下文中，`PROJECT.name` 和 `DEPARTMENT.name` 不是指项目名和部门名必须一致。这里的 `name` 实际上是指在两个表中用于连接 PROJECT 和 DEPARTMENT 表的公共字段。在 PROJECT 表中，`name` 是一个外键，它引用了 DEPARTMENT 表中的主键 `name`，这意味着每个项目都与一个特定的部门相关联。这种关联使得我们能够根据项目信息查询相关联的部门信息。

现在，我来回答问题 16：

正确实现“查找目前没有进行任何项目的部门名称”的查询是选项 d:

d.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM DEPARTMENT
WHERE name NOT IN (SELECT name
                   FROM PROJECT);
```

解释：

* 这个查询从 DEPARTMENT 表中选择部门名称，但只选择那些不在 PROJECT 表中出现的名称。
* `WHERE name NOT IN` 子句用于识别那些在 PROJECT 表中没有对应项目的部门。如果一个部门的名称没有出现在 PROJECT 表的任何行中，这意味着该部门目前没有进行任何项目。
* 其他选项不正确，因为：
    * a. 从 PROJECT 表中选择名称并不会给我们想要的信息。
    * b. 和 c. 使用 `name is NULL` 是不正确的，因为这会查找 `name` 字段为 NULL 的行，而不是查找没有进行任何项目的部门。

Question 17
A relational table PROJECT(code, title, name) contains information about the projects. A row in a relational table PROJECT consists of a project code, project title and name of department working on a project.

A relational table DEPARTMENT(name, chair) contains information about the departments. A row in a relational table DEPARTMENT consists of department name and chairperson name of a department. A column name in a relational table DEPARTMENT is a primary key. A column name in a relational table PROJECT is a foreign key referencing a column name in a relational table DEPARTMENT.

A correct implementation of a query “find the codes of project not being implemented by any department” is the following.

a.

**ChatGPT:**

The correct implementation of the query to “find the codes of projects not being implemented by any department” is option a:

a.

```sql
SELECT code
FROM PROJECT
WHERE name is NULL;
```

Explanation:

* In the context of this database schema, if a project in the PROJECT table does not have an associated department, the `name` field (which is a foreign key to the DEPARTMENT table) would be NULL.
* This query selects the project codes from the PROJECT table where there is no associated department name (i.e., the `name` field is NULL).
* The other options are incorrect because:
    * b. This condition would not yield any results as it checks for project names not in the PROJECT table itself, which is not logically correct.
    * c. Checking for project names not in the DEPARTMENT table does not necessarily mean those projects are not being implemented by any department.
    * d. This JOIN operation with a NULL check in the WHERE clause does not correctly capture projects not implemented by any department.

中文解释：

正确实现“查找没有被任何部门实施的项目代码”的查询是选项 a:

a.

```sql
SELECT code
FROM PROJECT
WHERE name is NULL;

解释：

* 在这个数据库架构的上下文中，如果 PROJECT 表中的项目没有关联的部门，`name` 字段（即指向 DEPARTMENT 表的外键）将会是 NULL。
* 这个查询从 PROJECT 表中选择没有关联部门名称的项目代码（即 `name` 字段为 NULL）。
* 其他选项不正确，因为：
    * b. 这个条件不会产生任何结果，因为它检查的是 PROJECT 表本身中不存在的项目名称，这在逻辑上是不正确的。
    * c. 检查不在 DEPARTMENT 表中的项目名称并不一定意味着这些项目没有被任何部门实施。

Question 18
A relational table PROJECT(code, title, name) contains information about the projects. A row in a relational table PROJECT consists of a project code, project title and name of department working on a project. Assume, that at most one department works on a project and a department can work on many projects. A column code is a primary key and column title is a candidate key.

A relational table DEPARTMENT(name, chair) contains information about the departments. A row in a relational table DEPARTMENT consists of department name and chairperson name of a department. A column name in a relational table DEPARTMENT is a primary key. A column name in a relational table PROJECT is a foreign key referencing a column name in a relational table DEPARTMENT.

A correct implementation of a query “find the names of departments that do not work on any projects now” is the following.

a.
SELECT name
FROM DEPARTMENT
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 0
                  FROM PROJECT
                  WHERE PROJECT.name = DEPARTMENT.name);

**ChatGPT:**

The correct implementation of the query to “find the names of departments that do not work on any projects now” is option a:

a.

FROM DEPARTMENT
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 0
                  FROM PROJECT
                  WHERE PROJECT.name = DEPARTMENT.name);
```

Explanation:

* This query selects the names of departments from the DEPARTMENT table where there is no corresponding entry in the PROJECT table.
* The `NOT EXISTS` subquery checks each department against the PROJECT table. If a department name does not have a corresponding entry in the PROJECT table (meaning the department is not working on any project), it is included in the results.
* The `SELECT 0` inside the NOT EXISTS subquery is a placeholder and is irrelevant to the logic; it's the existence of rows that match the condition which matters.

The other options are incorrect because:

* b. The syntax `WHERE NOT EXISTS name IN` is not valid SQL.
* c. This query checks for department names not present in the PROJECT table, but does not link the PROJECT and DEPARTMENT tables correctly.
* d. While similar to option a, checking for the existence of `title` is not relevant to finding departments not working on any projects.

中文解释：

正确实现“查找目前没有进行任何项目的部门名称”的查询是选项 a:

a.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM DEPARTMENT
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 0
                  FROM PROJECT
                  WHERE PROJECT.name = DEPARTMENT.name);
```

解释：

* 这个查询从 DEPARTMENT 表中选择没有在 PROJECT 表中对应条目的部门的名称。
* `NOT EXISTS` 子查询检查每个部门是否在 PROJECT 表中有对应条目。如果一个部门的名称在 PROJECT 表中没有对应条目（即该部门没有进行任何项目），则它会被包含在结果中。
* `NOT EXISTS` 子查询内的 `SELECT 0` 是一个占位符，与逻辑无关；重要的是满足条件的行是否存在。

Question 19
An inline view is


a.
SELECT statement enclosed within the left and right brackets and with an optional inline view name following a right bracket

b.
SELECT statement written in one line

c.
Nested SELECT statement

d.
SELECT statement that spans on many lines

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

An inline view is:

a. SELECT statement enclosed within the left and right brackets and with an optional inline view name following a right bracket

Explanation:

* An inline view in SQL is essentially a subquery used in the FROM clause of a SELECT statement. It acts like a temporary table that is generated and used during the execution of the query.
* The inline view is enclosed in parentheses and can optionally be given a name (alias) that can be used to refer to it in the outer query.
* It allows for more complex queries and can be used to simplify the query by breaking it down into more manageable parts.
* The other options are not correct descriptions of an inline view:
    * b. The physical layout of the SELECT statement (being on one line) does not define an inline view.
    * c. While an inline view is a form of a nested SELECT statement, this description is not specific enough.
    * d. The span of the SELECT statement over many lines is also not a characteristic that defines an inline view.

中文解释：

内联视图是：

a. SELECT 语句被包含在左右括号内，并且在右括号后面可以选择性地跟一个内联视图名称。

解释：

* SQL 中的内联视图本质上是一个在 SELECT 语句的 FROM 子句中使用的子查询。它充当临时表，生成并用于查询执行期间。
* 内联视图被包含在括号内，并且可以选择性地给它一个名称（别名），这个名称可以在外部查询中用来引用它。
* 它允许进行更复杂的查询，并且可以用来通过将查询分解成更易管理的部分来简化查询。
* 其他选项不是内联视图的正确描述：
    * b. SELECT 语句的物理布局（在一行上）并不定义内联视图。
    * c. 虽然内联视图是嵌套 SELECT 语句的一种形式，但这个描述不够具体。
    * d. SELECT 语句跨越多行的特征也不是定义内联视图的特点。

Question 20
An inline view can be used to

a.
Improve performance of processing of SELECT statement

b.
Simplify implementation process of SELECT statement

c.
Make SELECT statement syntactically correct

d.
Reduce the total number of lines occupied by SELECT statement

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

An inline view can be used to:

b. Simplify the implementation process of the SELECT statement

Explanation:

* Inline views are often used to break down complex queries into simpler parts. By using an inline view, you can encapsulate a part of your query in a subquery in the FROM clause. This can make the overall SELECT statement more manageable and easier to understand.
* Inline views can help in organizing and structuring queries, especially when dealing with complex data transformations or aggregations.
* While inline views can potentially improve readability and maintainability, they do not inherently improve the performance of a query (a), make a SELECT statement syntactically correct (c), or reduce the total number of lines in a query (d). Their primary purpose is to simplify and organize the structure of complex queries.

中文解释：

内联视图可以用来：

b. 简化 SELECT 语句的实现过程

解释：

* 内联视图通常用于将复杂查询分解为更简单的部分。通过使用内联视图，你可以在 FROM 子句中用子查询封装查询的一部分。这可以使整个 SELECT 语句更易于管理和理解。
* 内联视图有助于组织和结构化查询，特别是在处理复杂的数据转换或聚合时。
* 虽然内联视图可能提高可读性和可维护性，但它们并不固有地提高查询的性能（a），使 SELECT 语句在语法上正确（c），或减少查询中的总行数（d）。它们的主要目的是简化和组织复杂查询的结构。
